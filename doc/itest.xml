The I-test is an asphericity test that is not based on a non-positive curvature argument.
If a finite group presentation passes the I-test, then the associated 2-complex is diagrammatically reducible (DR),in particular it is aspherical.
This test was introduced by Barmak and Minian <Cite Key="BarmakMinian" Where="Theorem 2.6"/>.
The main function of the package is <Ref Func="ITest"/>.
